# MCVanillaChunkLoader
A primitive AFK AutoHotkey script that mass loads a pre-determined chunk range in Minecraft Bedrock/Java edition.

This was born from wanting to convert my Bedrock world which originated as a Nintendo Switch world in 2018 to Java. Now the world is at a point where it is too laggy to play on my Switch, i'm ready to comitt it to Java.

The default range is a square from 15000 to -15000 (corner to corner) however this can be sorted to your needs with the teleport.txt file.

This script is primitive and requires Minecraft to be focused on screen and isn't the fastest, the sweet spot is around 14 seconds per run.



Prerequisites
=============
-Minecraft Bedrock/Java edition
-AutoHotkey v1
-A PC that isn't a potato* (see config)

Optional for verification
=========================
-Amulet or Chunker
-A world map addon

====================================================

Installation and use
=====================
-Download "Chunk Loader.ahk" and "teleport.txt" into the same folder, or if you like chaos, you can do separate folders for both.
-Open "Chunk Loader.ahk" in a text editor (Notepad++ is best)
-Navigate to line 9 and change the file path to where "teleport.txt" is located.
